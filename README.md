# KarmaYoga
Karma yoga is oneâ€™s path of devotion to selfless work. In other words, it is a yoga of action. It signifies that one has to devote time, energy, and effort to any task. There should not be any expectation of a reward or approval. It is considered a humbling practice as one works not for the ego but the greater good.
